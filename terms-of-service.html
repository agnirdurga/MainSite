         (“Terms of Service”, “Terms”), including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein
         and/or available by hyperlink. These Terms apply to all users of the site, including without limitation users

         responsibility to check this page periodically for changes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Description of Service and Product</h3>
      <p> </p>

         subscribed to.</p>

         <p> </p>
         <p>In order to use certain features of the Site or Services, you must register for an account with Company
            (“Account”). This ‘Account’ will get created when you sign up for our Service. You represent and warrant
